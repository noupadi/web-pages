                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>
                                <span class="first-letter">W</span>orld has faced a global <u>education crisis</u>. 
                                The pandemic severely caused educational disruptions 
                                and rose new challenges concerning education. Insufficient knowledge 
                                and skills are commonly mentioned as an impediment to 
                                effective information and communications techonoly use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <u>Gender inequalities</u> are still to the date a remaining statistical factor. 
                                According to data about gender parity in the poportion of children 
                                meeting the minimum learning proficiency standards in reading and lower 
                                secondary school completion rates. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Secondly one sixth of the counties with 
                                relevant data had parity between <u>rural</u> and <u>urban</u> areas. 
                                Almost no country achieved parity between comparison of a 
                                child from <u>poor</u> family to a child from <u>rich</u> family.

                        <h3>An educated view on equality</h3>
                        
                            <p>
                                <span class="first-letter">W</span>riter is a last year major student in the faculty of education. 
                                Hopeing this presented view would make one think and maybe wake new thoughts about the subject.
                                The view is built of university studies, experiences in the fiel as a teacher and own experience in the schoolsystem as a student.
                                Studies in the field of education along with attained experiences has required to reflect on education 
                                and on choices in the class room on both general and personal level. Subject about different 
                                kind of learners and students who are struggling more or less in the school system has especially been a target of my interest.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As a teacher, I have learned the hardway how difficult it actually is to teach.
                                Teaching children requires understanding of differences how knowledge is aquired and 
                                how learning works in theory. This understanding process starts from understanding about 
                                learning. Teaching can be build on the understanding of what learning is. <em>There
                                isn't teaching without learning, is there.</em>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From understanding what and how learning is structured we can continue into thinking about 
                                the very ground of our teaching. The understanding of how difficult it can be to someone is very crucial. 
                                As a teacher my teaching always begins from the approach of, <em>how even the weakest learner gets an equal chance to learn.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                We could ask ourselves: Do we teach evyone the same, do we give the required support to the weakest, strongest or everyone equally, 
                                should we challenge everyone with the same tasks or do we challenge everyone to their own level of knowlede, capabilities and skills 
                                or where should we start with the teaching to make sure everyone has the required undrestanding? Should we teach the class based on the weakest learner or to teach the class based on the fastest learner? In either
                                of the situations one will be left out side. At this point teaching becoms an ethical question. Who we teach, who we include and who we leave outside.. This topic goes on and on!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The questions and aswers about above are little different based on the school level we are working at partly because of the curriculum but also individual capabilities, which is closely tied to individual age.
                                Maybe I have raised a few thoughts about the thoughts that go into teaching, maybe I have not reached anyone. But as a weak learner, 
                                I have felt like being left out from time after time. Wether this feeling is true or False, this has been the case very often.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <b><em>To sum up</em></b>: The feeling that learning difficulties are not understood or are left unattended in the layout or planning of the teaching is very usual. 
                                I am on a mission to raise awareness about this
